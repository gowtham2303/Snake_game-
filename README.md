# Snake_game-
A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle library. Have fun controlling the snake, growing it, and avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.


# Replicated Snake Game

This Snake game in Python, using the Turtle library, is a replication of a project. The focus is on a logical approach to the game with a simple black and white visual style.

## Files

- **main.py:** Entry point of the game. Initializes and starts the game.
- **snake.py:** Contains the Snake class and logic for snake movement and growth.
- **scoreboard.py:** Manages the game score and scoreboard display.
- **food.py:** Implements the Food class for generating snake food.
- **data.txt:** Stores game-related data (e.g., high score).

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run `main.py` to start the game.
3. Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
4. Try to eat the food to score points and grow the snake.
5. Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

- Simple black and white visuals for a focus on the game's logical approach.
- Score tracking and high-score persistence in `data.txt`.
- Game over screen with the option to play again.

## Replication Source

This project is a replication of a Snake game project presented in Python 100 days Bootcamp By Dr.Angela yu. The code structure and logic closely follow the teachings of that source.

## Future Improvements

This project is open to contributions. Feel free to suggest improvements, report bugs, or add new features. Contributions are welcome!

## Acknowledgments

This project was replicated based on a lecture or tutorial, with credit to the original source for inspiration.

Enjoy playing the replicated game and happy coding!
